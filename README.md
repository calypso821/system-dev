# Unix/Linux System Programming in C

This repository contains various examples and implementations of system programming concepts in C for Unix/Linux systems. The code examples cover fundamental operating system concepts and system calls.

## Repository Structure

### Basic Concepts
- Pointers and memory management
- Dynamic memory allocation (1D and 2D arrays)
- File operations and directory handling

### Process Management
- Process creation and termination (`fork`, `exec`)
- Parent-child process relationships
- Signal handling
- Custom shell implementation

### Interprocess Communication (IPC)
- Pipes
- Message queues
- Shared memory
- Semaphores

### Thread Programming
- Basic thread creation and management
- Thread synchronization with mutexes
- Parallel computation examples (Monte Carlo methods)

### Network Programming
- TCP/IP client-server implementations
- Socket programming
- Parallel server implementations
- Network game example (Blackjack)

### Device Drivers
- Basic Linux kernel module examples
- Character device drivers
- GPIO handling for Raspberry Pi
